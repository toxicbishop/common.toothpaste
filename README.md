# GitHub Contribution Graph Generator

This tool helps you fill your GitHub contribution graph with commits.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. Follow the prompts to:
    * Select the year you want to target (e.g., `-1` for last year).
    * Choose how many commits to generate.
    * Automatic git commits will be created.

## Notes

* Commits are backdated.
* The script uses `data.txt` to store dummy commit data.
